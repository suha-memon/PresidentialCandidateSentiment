302467,nothing //
302469,"I do kind of enjoy his - he's funny.  He isn't a politicion.  He isn't afraid to tell people off.  He's not doing this for the money.  He used to talk about how frustrated he was with the economy.  I think other countries think we're weak.  I would just like a fresh face, a new perspective.  Hopefully, he will have some good people around to advise him.  I still believe in the Republican party."

302557,he is not part of the political establisment//
302558,
302559,
302562,"I like that he is somewhat of a conservative business man and it sounds like he might appropriate some of the money, some of our tax money towards programs and really towards programs that will help our country rather than programs that are not helping at all. It sounds like he will take away some of the money that might go toward defense and concentrate on social programs like education and police and firefighter social welfare, I suppose. I don't know if that's the right word for him but I feel like we can take care of things here if we feel like were spending abroad. I feel like it could be better used in this country.// Um,, I wouldn't say so,, like I said he wasnt a good a business man at first and he learned from his mistakes. His morals don't fit with mine.//No I think I can stop there."

Iknow that (phone is ringing)I was saying this guy is crazy but he might bring something different and that is on my mind because he is different.//So if I was going to vote, i'm not registered. That's probably where i would go. I know Hilary would just be a continuation of Obama.//"
302580,
302581,He's not Hillary Clinton//

302604,
302606,
302610,"He is not Hilary Clinton.//I am not necessarily a fan of Trump, I am just not that much a fan of Hilary Clinton.//I think every year the pool of candidates from both parties gets worse and worse. I could probably write a thousand word essay on this topic.//"
302612,Making this better.  Getting it back on track...even though he has so many faults//Uh..that's it
302613,I think he would make a good President. Either one would be great I think it would be. //
302614,
302615,"he is going to make the economy better, hoping he will help the education system"
302621,"i don'tknow maybe he could be better than Hiliary on his leadership qualities, and he has his own thoughts and opinions and leadership qualities about letting people in th county\\"
302626,I think he will be a very strong and capable president//I feel if he doesnt know something he will hire someone who does. He won't just blurt something out.
302627,he is realistic
302629,
302632,
302634,
302639,the financial how he wants to straighten out finances and agree to buld a wall and only let us citizens come across the wall and he wants to bring jobs back to US  has had several friends who has lost jobs as jobs are being shipped overseas.   I believe that america back in the financial status all say that whether or not is true i don't know
302643,"He's frank.  Honestly, I kind of admire someone who steps into the policial arena and does not play the political game.//"
302645,
302648,
302651,
302652,
302653,"He is a relentless winner.//He believes along the same lines that I do as far as people shoulc pull their on weight.  Against hand-outs for people that don't work.// Another strong point is he has a vast network of people that he trust that have many skills in different areas and he has skills himself as a organizer and he is someone who listenes to different viewpoints and decisivive. He is an honest man, sometime that gets him in trouble, but you can't get into too much trouble by telling the truth.//"
302657,I'd say his business perspective.//
302659,
302660,"His ability not to mence words and not a political figure, wants to run the country like he would run a business/"
302661,nstional sircuity//

302665,probably because he is so spunky
302667,
302669,

302680,He's an idealist and he wants to be progressive
302684,"cares a little bit more about the race, cares more about the country, great interest in helping out or at least attemtping too"
302699,That he's not owned by the politicians//he's honest//he's conservative//
302707,that he is running against Hilary//
302709,
302710,He's a business man/
302713,He will stop people from coming into our country from using the system. I highly agree with him.  I think he would do very well as a president and he would change everything and our family is hoping. //
302714,He is not a career politician//He is not afraid to stand up and use direct verbage instead of politically correct passive BS//Agree with closing the border//And most everything else he says
302717,because he is outside of the political system//not specifically//
302719,
302720,
302722,
302723,
302724,
302726,"Yea, I'm not sure what. Well , yes. He's not a carreer politician. He speaks his mind. It may not always be politically correct but then so what!//He's not tied to any special interest that I know of.//I cant think of anything."
302730,
302731,
302733,
302734,
302736,Hes a good buisnessman.//  I just like how he talks.  He is a smart aleck too.//
302739,"THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT HIS POLICY THAT I AGREE WITH HIM, HE IS OUTSPOKEN, BUT HE HAS HAD ME LIKING HIM AT TIMES IN HIS POLICY//"
302741,I would say he is not a career policitan//I like the fact that he will say what is on him mind//
302746,"he has his challeges as well however he is outside the polical process and I think we need a change. I'm not happy with the republican or democrate party have handled themselves.I would hope that Donald, if he gets elected will be able to change some things/I believe theres' a great deal of waste in the gov't and that needs to be addressed. my professional business was to help clients become more efficient and effective and I hope Donald will be able to do that wiht our gov't. /"
302751,I think there could be a change in politics. With Clinton its a continuation of what we have now. I do not agree with Trump about the wall.\\
302752,"Like his tax policy, his idea of US foriegn policy//"
302754,
302755,
302757,I guess he is the lesser of two evils. There really is not much more I want to say about that. People are going to die when they read my review.
302760,
302761,I think that he would get things done a lot better with war and immigration without being a citizen.
302764,He tells it like it is but he doesnt always tell the truth. He has endless energy//
302765,not Hilary clinton//
302770,"Like alot of thinks he wants to do, bring jobs back to American, increase inport taxes, defend against ISIS, just dont like Hillary Clinton//"
302771,"basically i dsthink he is about the same as hilary, i can't believe the country can only come up eith the these two candidates, trump and clinton, it is a sad state of affairs,// i know it is the electioral college that has the real vote, and  that it is a reassurance ritual to make the american people  think they have a vote in this.// i wish it was 1980 again and Ronald reagan was running"
302774,He speaks his mind//
302779,
302781,
302782,"gun policy, borders, immigration stuff, keep letting people in they have alreay started mass shootings and bombings in the us.  hilary lets people in and hold off a bit and find a better way dont just let them in here without checks already seen sevearl issues."
302785,
302786,"I like his pro life stance, that's important to me. and overall, I feel like he does fight for certain freedoms a little bit more than Hillary does. //"
302787,
302790,"a little better than Hillary Clinton, heard good things about him and I hope he doesn't get assinated if he wins"
302791,what i like about him would be change//he is not a career politician//his background is business is what this country needs right now

302812,
302813,
302815,i like what he talks about he talks about the people fist and that's what this is all about I think he's our best choice to go forward as a nation//
302816,Ninet nine percent of what he says that we need to go back to.When you have two choices it is not hard to make a decision when what you hve to choose from is night and day different you naturally choose who is closest to your beliefs.
302821,"just some of his beliefs, he is abusiness man i hope he can straighten out some of the problems we have. iknow he has his faults but so does everyone else, so out of the two he will do a better job\\"

302866,not a political person//
302867,lessor of two evils
302871,I just like his view on things. This year has been a choice of bad and badder. I'm not real happy with either one of them but i lean more toward some of the things that Trump stands for.//
302872,His fiscal responsibility -
302873,not for partial birth abortions
302874,I like his ideas.  I strongly agree all of his ideas in the way America need to go in.  I think he will fix health care.// I support his as far as building the wall.  I think he will bring jbs back to America.//
