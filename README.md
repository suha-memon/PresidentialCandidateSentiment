# Presidential Candidate Sentiment

In this R project, I will be analyzing sentiment about the 2016 presidential election candidates using R (primarily word bubbles).

To access the code for the following procedures, please reference [presidential_candidate_analysis.R](http://github.com/user/project/blob/master/Readme.md#my-anchor](https://github.com/suha-memon/PresidentialCandidateSentiment/blob/ee3b4ec8ee84752c3b10a0196f3662ca3fdc3b4d/presidential_candidate_analysis.R#L1)) or  or presidential_candidate_analysis.Rmd to see the outputs.
