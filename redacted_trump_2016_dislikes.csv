He's never run for political office before so he has to learn as he goes.  I kind of feel sorry for him because he has no idea what the political process is like.  So he's learning now, but he's having to learn awfully fast.  I think he's smart enough but the temperament is the thing that bothers me the most.

Like if you look at the statements they've made verbatim, they've made certain statements um I guess about just like scapegoating certain racial and ethnic populations, or our national issues that have been forming for centuries. So if you look at how Donald Trump is treating people of color, people of Mexican decsent, it is very siimilar to how Hitler was framing Jewish populations 80 years ago and it is just very concerning. His ideas for like building a wall to separate ethnic populations, and saying things like certain ethnic groups are all rapists and criminals, it is the same tactics used to demonize Jewish people. And it's like very fear based and propoganda based, and I feel like a lot of people aren't taking as seriously as I am. At first I was very afraid of the similarities betwwen Donald Trump and Hitler, and then I started to conside"

Um, like I said his values don't fit with mine. He is a business man and he is a very self serving man and I think that kind of continues with the issues some of this coutry has had and it has over the past decades. Um, the other big problem I have is he is a big propronent of trickle down economics and trying to lower taxes for big business and he expects them to hire more exployees and that doesn't always work.// Um, that's good."
302564,//his views on what he would do for the disabled

I think when he talks about immigration, I honestly feel like he is talking a lot of truth. I know we tend to get into exageration. When He talks about the bad seeds, I think he means get rid of bad seeds not the legitimate people working. Its kinda hard with Donald Trump.

He kept interrupting hillary in the last debate. The mediator had to keep telling him this is her 2 minutes. He makes me nervous, he makes a lot of people nervous, having the nuclear codes. He doesn't listen to even his own people in his campaign. He's gonna be himself no matter what. When they're done talking he's going to do what he wants no matter what. // I've never been this nervous about anyone who's ran for president. We need someone who will talk to foreign leaders and doesn't have his mind made up already. He's like the wild west era. He has so much money he doesn't care what ... he hasn't released tax returns. He most recently bragged about the reason he didn't pay taxes in the year Hillary refered to was that he's smart. I think that statement alone is the one that keeps him out of the office.
