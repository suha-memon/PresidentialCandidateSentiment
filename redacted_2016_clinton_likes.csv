My [REDACTED RELATIVE] wroter to Hillary Clinton when her husband was president & they sent  someone out here to fix the wall.  They listened to one person. Our representative [REDACTED DETAILS] wouldn't listen.  She showed me she cares about the regular person.  I think she is qualified being secretary of state.  Trump has no qualifications..didn't even serve in the military.  I think the man is a total idiot.

300541,
300542,I like the fact she has a strong policy.  I think she has been in and around the office of the presidency and understands the position.  I think she embodies the cares and concerns of the entire country.//
300543,

And, I think she'll do a good job. // She certainly has a lot of experience. // Well, I believe in the democratic platform and, uh, I um, Hillary has not been necessarily the most progressive as Bernie Sanders.

300575,her being a female we have never had a female and maybe that's what we need
300578,
300581,"I think she is more political. She has more experience, political knowledge. Of course, Bill was president and the ecomony was good when Bill was in office and the other nations like him. They liked the Clinton adminstration. I look at how the other countries view the US.// The economy was good when he was in office if you just look at him being president and not the other stuff  . I just think Hilary has more experience.//"
300583,"Um, she has a lot of experience, and I believe that she has done a lot of humanitarian; made a lot of humanitarian efforts. And, I um, agree with most of her views. //"

I really don't trust her. But compared to Trump, she's a gem. (I like her. She likes women. I think she over did it with all those emails. and I still don't know but apparently it awas not illegal because the FBI went through all that.\\"

300621,
300622,The factthat she could be the first female president is interesting. Not sure thats enough to vote for her because I have other issues. And that I trust that she will be a politician. Thats probably the best phrase I can give you.//
300628,
300629,she speaks very well
300632,"IF i HAD TO CHOOSE, IF i DONT WANT TO VOTE FOR HER i HAVE TO VOTE FOR CLINTON, SHE HAS LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND SHOWS THAT SHE WILL BE GOOD PRESIDENT.  BETTER THAN TRUMP.  DONT HAVE ANOTHER OPTION//"

300660,
300663,
300674,She's got the experience//

300680,
300687,

300694,"her personality her education, her aspirations for our country, her represntation of my feelings about the world and people her loyalty to her husband, her determination to accomplish what she decided to tackle, she is really a very determined person//I think I'd like her as a person, I think she's a good bet// I'm not naive about her at all, I know things that aren't terribly complimentary, because of her status in the world she is involved in boards of directors and trustees and that could make it difficult for her to be completely forthright, the higher the echelons, the more apt they are to have to make decisions I might not agree with// that's really the way I feel, to me it's not her fault, it's just the way it is that's what I believe"
300695,where she stands on women and childre. I like her opinion on Black Lives matter and all the people who have been coming after her. I think she's got a good head on her shoulders.// I like how our country was when her husband was President . I would like it if she won because i know that He would be there with her. Our country's economy was so much better then and not as many wars.

301666,"Mostly her progressive stances, her stances on inclusion and equality.//Her political experience and the fact that she has already been in the White House and this wouldn't be uncharted territory for her.//There would be too much at stake if Donald Trump won the election so a vote for Hiliary means a vote against Donald Trump which is another reason why Iam voting for her.

But the man who is running, doesn't have a great character in my mind either. // I do like the fact that she does want to make college affordable. I think that is something that should happen. //"
301694,
301695,

301760,
301761,Experience.//
301766,"I respect her foreign policy. I appreciate what she did while she was Secretary of State. She made good strides. I appreciate what she did with Barack Obama when she barged intio the meeting and were talking about environmental policies. They took it over and really forged a pathway to cleaner air and better environmental policies.//I like that she has been a Senator, she has been in Congress. She knows that she has to work for what she needs to do. She knows her way around. People say they hate career politicians but I appreciate that she does have the experience. I appreciate that she has taken on some of Bernie Sander's policies: raising the minimum wage, health care, maternity leave. So I would like to see more of that out of her.//"

301893,The Democratic platform//her experience//she's by far the better of the two candidates
301894,"You know, that's really confusing because I,, the whole issue about the emails and all that kind of stuff. I guess in the long run she is human. She is a traditional politician. Hilary is not a great speaker. It's obvious she's not comfortable doing public speaches. She not particularly articulate but neither is Donald. I think he vocabulary is 9th grade level, 10th grade level. I think the problem I have with Hilary is Bill. That probably sounds weird. I don't like him . I didn't vote for him. I'm an independant. I voted for him the first time but I didn' t the second time. I know that is nothing I shouldn't hold against her. The positive thing is they did release financial records. The knew they were going to take a hit on that. They recognized that and they decided what they were going to do about the Foundation. They knew they were going to be under scrutiny but Donald hasn't done that. I think that's a big positive. I really do . If they are going to call that transparecy, that's as close as they get."
301895,She is not Donald Trump// Her policies//Her experiences
301896,If nothing happened there wouldn't be a big headline about it. If she didn't do anyhting wrong.
301897,
301902,
301904,I agree with her more on some social issues such as women's right and gay rights.  I don't agree with her economic policies.//I would be more fiscally conservative//
301906,"My main reason is that she's the Democratic candidate and I like where she stands on women's rights and um just minority rights in general. And, just the reason for not privitizing our healthcare and prison system. And, not allowing racial profiling. And, her recent flip flop on no longer agreeing with the TPP. //"
301909,

Yes, I know baseed on watching the debates , her plan seems to make sense about the gun control policy. All her plans , especially about the gun policy. To me, she has a good head on her shoulders. She is married to a president and she has experience herself being around the government. Isn't she a senator or something? She is something.//That'd be all."
301958,everything

302559,"The fact that she is not trying to stop people from coming here to work, equal opportunity. Mostly, my strong point I dont she labels people, and taking things out content.//"
302562,"I think Hilary's focus especially after the primarys has been on making sure that social welfare is a large part of her focus if she gets elected. That includes lowering taxes for the middle class. That includes focusing on renewable energy jobs and putting money toward that industry.//Um, She is a big proponent for equality from what I;ve heard,,,abortion rights, gay rights, rights for women and men. She sounds like she's for equality. I will go into why Iwont vote for her in a minute. She is also a proponent for religious rights and choice. Freedom from religious persecution, I guess.//Something that I just read kind of made sense is she's been scrutinized fairly heavily compared to any politician that I've experienced. 8 years of politicians that I've been exposed to . She 's been in politics for a very long time. Its good and bad but she has that experience to how things work or won't work. My question is as to how things will change or adapt. I wonder if she'll change or adapt after all that experience."

302595,"Her experience. Her husband having served as president for 8 years, there's nobody better to have in your bench then someone that has had that job. In a crisis we have a good team there. I think she makes calculated decisions, and doesn't shoot from the hip. She listens to other aides and people around her before she makes a decision. I feel that, I know she does. //"
